Exercise
Time to take out a notebook. When you encounter one of these steps and its sub-steps, write it down.
Also write down anything that resonates with you. In the final exercise, you'll be asked to share it. Writing it down may also help you really understand why it feels so relatable to you.

Set the stage
The first major step to becoming a better learner is to set the stage. This step of the process is about priming your brain to receive new information. Setting the stage consists of three sub-steps.
	1. Clear the stage: write down anything that is on your mind. Add it to a to-do list or a journal. Turn off all distractions and notifications.
	2. Clarify the what and the why: The what is your objective, your goal, what you're trying to achieve. The why is the meaning or motivation behind the learning. Write down objectives.
	3. Prioritize process over product: ZPD. Prioritize process over product. Focused and deliberate practice will deliver better results. Learn in order and think about the order your learning in. The flip-side, product over process, leads to shortcuts and cheating to reach the end result.

Play
	1. Wrestle with it:  think about it from different perspectives. If you look from a 2D perspective it will be hard to claim that you fully understand it. Exposing yourself once will not be enough. Read about it, write about it, talk about it, code about it, repeat over and over until you remember, it becomes second nature, you develop muscle memory. Engage multiple parts of your brain in multiple ways.
	2. Take risks: have a growth mindset. Try to change your way of thinking.
	3. Have fun! Check in with your body. If your tense you're probably not having fun. Take a break.

Reflect
	1. Self assess: Ask the following at the end of each day:
		• What were my objectives?
		• How far did I get?
		• How much is left?
		• How was the process?
		• Did I set the stage well?
		• Did I play well?
		• What can I do better next time?
	2. Ask new questions: Helps solidify what you know, primes you to start the process again by providing motivation. Write these questions down so you can review them.
	3. Repeat
