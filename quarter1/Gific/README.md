# Gific

This is a project that I created at the end of my first quarter at Galvanize.

Gific is an interactive comic-strip maker that pulls from the Giphy API, allowing you to create a Gific using Gifs. The title of your Gific can be entered manually or randomly generated, and text can be added to correspond with each gif, which can also be randomly generated or searched for using keywords.
